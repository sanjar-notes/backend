#### Why
The infrastructure providing data to the front-end (for presentation) is the backend.

#### How

* Data is persisted on computers, called 'servers' here. They're constantly listening for requests and provide relevant resposes with data/files.
* Servers process CRUD operations as per requests, and can do the usual compute too.


#### What
So, backend is the part of the web app that user don't directly interact with. This is the 2nd half of web development.
