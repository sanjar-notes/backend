====== 5. AJAX ======
Created Monday 25 October 2021

=== Why ===
This a technique where we do a GET request and render the page partially, without a refresh.

It's basically a partial rendering based on multiple HTTP requests.

Basically, the front-end (page) and communication with the backend are not tied together.

It's simple, intuitive.

The only "new" thing, if any, is that the page can be rendered without reloading. This is true.

=== How ===
Basic communication with the server.

=== What ===
So, AJAX is just a way to do stuff. It's a combination of basic tools:
1. HTTP request to GET data.
2. Figuring out the data/effect to render
3. Render the page partially
Done!
