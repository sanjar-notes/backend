# 0. Singular architecture
Created Tuesday 14 December 2021

## Why

* For very simple apps or for Web1.0 apps, where static files had to be server.
* The whole file was kind of a hash table with key=URL, value=File. That's all.
* All functioning code could be written, without any separation of concerns.
* It's still valid for very small apps, or apps that won't have to change in the future.
